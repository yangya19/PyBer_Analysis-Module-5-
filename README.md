# Pyber Analysis

## 1. Overview of Analysis Purpose

Create a summary dataframe of the ride-sharing data by city type, data and time and fare amount. Using multiple-line graph to identify if there is a trend for total weekly fares for each city type. Other detailed metrics include:

* Total number of rides for each city
* Total number of drivers for each city type
* Sum of the fares for each city type
* Average fare per ride for each city type
* Average fare per driver for each city type


## 2. Analysis Results
From summary dataframe, we can see urban has the highest rides count, highest driver amount and highest value of total fares. However, the average fare rate and average fare per driver at urban is the lowest. On the other side, although rural city type has the lowest total fares amount, the average fare per ride and per driver is the highest. 

The line graph shows rural city types have relatively stable fare amounts for every week, which stays in range $0-$500. Urban's fare amounts per week flucturates the most among three city types. 



## 3. Summary

1. Rural city type needs more drivers to increase total ride counts and decreases cost on the average fare per ride.
2. Looks like the third week in Feburary has demand increase on rides in all city types, get more drivers prepared in that week.
3. Urban driver's average fare is way lower than the average fare in Suburban and Rural. Consider to increase the average fare per driver in urban to keep the same productivity.
